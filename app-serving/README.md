# LARCO Monitor: the Stage 5 model, served, on a washing machine

A browser workbench that replays one becken-flt cycle, the faulty second unit
the model never saw a cycle of, at 200 Hz, and shows the state a **serving
agent** on the Archetype AI platform calls for each 2.56 s window: fill, wash,
spin or drain. It is Stage 8 (`fit/serve.py`) made visible: the same bundle of
the promoted blueprint and the same queries, one window at a time, as it arrives.

> **Dev and Staging.** Agent serving is on Dev (`https://platform.dev.u1.archetypeai.app`), with 3
> serving workers shared by everyone, and Staging (`https://platform.stage.u1.archetypeai.app`);
> not prod. The app holds a worker while it runs and gives it back when it stops
> ([Stop and clean up](#stop-and-clean-up)).

- **Input:** the cycle's nine accelerometer channels (back, side and top, x/y/z):
  each window's trace, its vibration level in g, and the level over the last
  minutes. Any of the 122 delivery files can be picked; the quickstart's five short
  cycles come first.
- **Output:** the machine drawn in the called state (water in, the drum rocking,
  spinning, water out), the four probabilities, a timeline of the whole cycle, the
  embedding space and a log of state changes. All of it is the agent's answer: the
  page shows no labels and no batch output (Stage 8 is where served is checked
  against batch).

```

- **The replayer** (`scripts/replayer.js`) reads one delivery file a window at a
  time: 512 rows, z-scored as the model was fitted, to `larco/sensors`. For the page
  it sends each window's level and a decimated trace in g. It sends a window every
  2.56 s divided by the speed, but never more than a few ahead of the agent's
  answers, and none while the bridge has no running agent.
- **The serving bridge** (`scripts/serving-bridge.js`) is the only process that
  talks to the platform, with the key from the repo's `.env`; the browser never
  sees it. At start it creates a bundle of the promoted blueprint, as Stage 8 does
  (`data_columns`, `timestamp_column: "timestamp"`), with `output_embeddings: true`,
  and runs it in serving mode; the platform supplies the serving connectors. Each query carries 1 to 8 whole consecutive windows
  (Settings → Windows per query), and each record goes back to `larco/results` with
  its window's cycle, index and timestamps (the served agent numbers rows within the
  query). `larco/agent` (retained) says what it is doing: starting, running,
  waiting for a free worker, replacing a released agent, stopped.
- **The page** subscribes to the broker over WebSockets; there is no backend.

**The served agent is the batch model.** Stage 8 measured 3,176 of 3,178 states
and 3,171 of 3,178 probability sets identical to Stage 6's, at 1 and at 8 windows a
query. A window near a tie can differ by one of the 31 neighbours' votes.

## The embedding space

The Embedding tab draws the library the model compares each window with: its
3,200 windows (about 800 a state, window 512, step 512) on the two directions of their Omega
embeddings, a dot each and a density per state, with the last minute or two of the
cycle as a trail, each point in the state the agent called. The model is a registry artifact
with no download route, so the library's embeddings were recomputed on the
platform, and the result ships with the repo: `static/library-view.{json,bin}`
(about 120 KB), from the promoted model (k 31, cosine) on Dev, 2026-10-18. The page
loads it at start; without it the tab says so and the rest of the app works. To
recompute it, for instance after promoting another model:

```sh
python fit/library_embeddings.py      # 4 batch runs, one per library file, then the view
```

The runs and their bundle go in `fit/out/library_state.json`, so a rerun resumes
and `python fit/cleanup.py --yes` deletes them.

The two directions are the ones that best separate the four states (each
embedding at unit length, as the model compares by cosine; PCA to 50 dimensions;
linear discriminant analysis to 2). PCA 1-2 alone mixed fill and wash. `python
fit/library_embeddings.py --view` redraws them from the saved outputs in
`fit/out/library_embeddings/`, with no platform calls.

It is a cross-section, not the model: the kNN compares all 6,912 dimensions
(cosine), and two directions are drawn, so a window can sit in one state's field here and still
be called another.

## Run it

Needs Stage 5 run on Dev or Staging (`fit/out/test_state.json`), the role files in `data/roles/`, Node 20+ and
mosquitto (`brew install mosquitto`).

```sh
cd app-serving
npm install
npm run dev                  # broker, bridge, replayer and the page: http://localhost:5182
```

The agent takes a minute or so to start; the badge in the menubar turns to
`platform · serving` once it runs. The replay starts on its own.

- **Cycle:** the selector in the Input panel. `CYCLE=warm_sport_40_2` in
  `app-serving/.env` starts on another file.
- **Speed** (Settings): 1×, 2×, 4× or 8× real time, or Max, as fast as the agent
  answers. Stage 8 measured 0.51 s a window at 1 a query and 0.26 s at 8 (without
  embeddings), so about 5× and 10× real time; above that the replay waits for the
  agent.
- **Windows per query** (Settings): 1 is live, as the machine's controller would
  ask every 2.56 s; more wait for each other but cost less each.

## Stop and clean up

**Stop it once:** Ctrl-C in the `npm run dev` terminal, or `npm run stop` from
another. The bridge cancels and deletes its agent and deletes its bundle, which
takes a few platform calls; `npm run stop` waits for it and checks the ports are
free.

**Check nothing is left:**

```sh
ls ../fit/out/app_serving_state.json      # gone once the bridge cleaned up
```

If it is still there (a `kill -9`, a closed laptop), the bridge couldn't finish:
`python fit/cleanup.py --yes` from the repo deletes what it lists. A serving agent
left running holds a worker (one of Dev's 3) until it is deleted, or released after
20 minutes without a query. The bridge refuses to start while the file is there.

The slot after the RED and TEP serving apps (`mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` has the
table), so they can run side by side. The full and quickstart examples' apps share
it: run one at a time.

`-labs` 0.19), with Geist in place of the licensed brand faces. Two deliberate
departures from the installed `CLAUDE.md`: the API key stays with the bridge rather
than being pasted into the page, so the browser never holds it; and the theme's own
`@import 'tailwindcss'` is the only Tailwind entry (two drop the DS base typography
in dev).
